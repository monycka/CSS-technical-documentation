            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages —
            for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your
            content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
            decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your
            path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the
            syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
            HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
            document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
            MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on
            screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of
            styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of
            elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on
            my page to be shown as large red text."

        <article>
          <p>
            The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that
            we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different
            ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come
            across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful
            way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.
          </p>
          <p>
            Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it
            as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.
          </p>
          <p>
            To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere
            inside the "head" of the HTML document:
            <br />
            <strong id="style">
              < link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" >
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This "link" element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet,
            using the rel attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the
            value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by
            adding a rule to styles.css.

            The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often
            referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Selector: </strong>This is the HTML element that we’re
              targeting. It can be an HTML tag, or it can be an ID or a Class
              (more about those later). The selector in this example is the
              anchor tag.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Declaration block start: </strong>An open curly brace "{"
              marks the start of a declaration block.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Property / Value separator: </strong>The colon : appears
              after the property.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Value: </strong>This is the value of the property. In this
              example, it’s white.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Declaration: </strong>The property/value pair combined is
              the declaration, indicated by the orange box in the above diagram.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Declaration separator: </strong>The semicolon ; marks the
              end of the declaration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Declaration block end: </strong>A closing curly brace "}"
              marks the end of a declaration block.

          <p>Declarations are style rules that add styling to HTML elements.</p>
          <p>
            By making our anchor tag white we have already demonstrated that we
            can target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an
            element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML
            element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use
            the selector "p".
          </p>
          <p>
            You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the
            selectors with a comma.

            braces ({ }).

          <li>
            Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the
            property from its value or values.
          </li>
          <li>
            Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each
            declaration from the next one.
          </li>
          <li>
            To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them

          <p>
            A selector targets HTML to apply styles to content. If CSS is not
            applying to content as expected, your selector may not match the way
            you think it should match. Each CSS rule starts with a selector — or
            a list of selectors — in order to tell the browser which element or
            elements the rules should apply to.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many different types of selectors. We can make more
            specific selections as well. Here are some of the more common types
            of selectors:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Element selector: </strong>Sometimes called a tag or type
              selector. It selects all HTML elements of the specified type. For example:
              <code>p selects < p > </p></code>
            </li>
            <li><strong>ID selector: </strong>It selects the element on the page with the specified ID. On a given HTML page, each id value should be unique. For example: <code> #my-id
              selects < p id="my-id" > or < a id="my-id" > </code></li>
            <li><strong>Class selector: </strong>It selects the element(s) on the page with the specified class. Multiple instances of the same class can appear on a page. For example: <code>.my-class
              selects < p class="my-class" > and < a class="my-class" > </code></li>
            <li><strong>Attribute selector: </strong>It selects the element(s) on the page with the specified attribute. For example:<code>img[src]
              selects < img src="myimage.png" > but not < img > </code></li>
            <li><strong>Pseudo-class selector: </strong>It selects the specified element(s), but only when in the specified state. (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.) For example: <code>a:hover
              selects < a >, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link.</code></li>
              <li><strong>Combinators: </strong>It combines other selectors in order to target elements within our documents. For example: <code> article > p { } selects p that are direct children of < article > using the child combinator (>)</code></li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <p>
            CSS @rules (pronounced "at-rules") provide instruction for what CSS should perform or how it should behave. Some @rules are simple with just a keyword and a value.
          </p>
          <p>
            One common @rule that you are likely to encounter is @media, which is used to create media queries. Media queries use conditional logic for applying CSS styling.
          </p>
          <p>Media queries:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Let you adapt your site or app depending on the presence or value of various device characteristics and parameters.
            </li>
            <li>
              They are a key component of responsive design. For example, a media query can shrink the font size on small devices, increase the padding between paragraphs when a page is viewed in portrait mode, or bump up the size of buttons on touchscreens.
            </li>
            <li>
              In HTML, media queries can be applied to various elements:
              <ul>
                <li>In the < link > element's media attribute, they define the media to which a linked resource (typically CSS) should be applied.</li>
                <li>In the < source > element's media attribute, they define the media to which that source should be applied. (This is only valid inside < picture > elements.)</li>
                <li>In the < style > element's media attribute, they define the media to which the style should be applied.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, RGBA, HEX, HSL, HSLA values.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Predefined color names: </strong>
            In CSS, a color can be specified by using a color name. For example:
            <ul>
              <li>Tomato</li>
              <li>Gray</li>
              <li>Orange</li>
              <li>SlateBlue</li>
              <li>Violet</li>
            </ul>
            CSS/HTML support <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colors.asp">140 standard color names</a>.
          </p>
          <p><strong>RGB value: </strong>A color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula: rgb(red, green, blue)
            <br />
            Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255. For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0. To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0). To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).</p>
            <p><strong>RGBA Value: </strong>They are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color. An RGBA color value is specified with: rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
              <br />
              The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all)</p>

            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
            conditions tested in sequence, as follows:

        <article>
          <p>
            The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
            If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
            condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
            stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
          </p>

          <p>
            To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
            group those statements.
          </p>
          <p>
            With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
            Therefore, x and n take on the following values:

            Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by

            changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
