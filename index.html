            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages —
            for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your
            content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
            decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your
            path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the
            syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
            HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
            document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
            MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on
            screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of
            styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of
            elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on
            my page to be shown as large red text."

        <article>
          <p>
            The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that
            we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different
            ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come
            across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful
            way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.
          </p>
          <p>
            Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it
            as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.
          </p>
          <p>
            To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere
            inside the "head" of the HTML document:
            <br />
            <strong id="style">
              < link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" >
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This "link" element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet,
            using the rel attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the
            value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by
            adding a rule to styles.css.

            The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often
            referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Selector: </strong>This is the HTML element that we’re
              targeting. It can be an HTML tag, or it can be an ID or a Class
              (more about those later). The selector in this example is the
              anchor tag.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Declaration block start: </strong>An open curly brace "{"
              marks the start of a declaration block.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Property / Value separator: </strong>The colon : appears
              after the property.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Value: </strong>This is the value of the property. In this
              example, it’s white.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Declaration: </strong>The property/value pair combined is
              the declaration, indicated by the orange box in the above diagram.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Declaration separator: </strong>The semicolon ; marks the
              end of the declaration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Declaration block end: </strong>A closing curly brace "}"
              marks the end of a declaration block.

          <p>Declarations are style rules that add styling to HTML elements.</p>
          <p>
            By making our anchor tag white we have already demonstrated that we
            can target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an
            element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML
            element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use
            the selector "p".
          </p>
          <p>
            You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the
            selectors with a comma.

          <li>
            Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the

          <li>
            Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each

          <p>
            A selector targets HTML to apply styles to content. If CSS is not
            applying to content as expected, your selector may not match the way
            you think it should match. Each CSS rule starts with a selector — or
            a list of selectors — in order to tell the browser which element or
            elements the rules should apply to.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many different types of selectors. We can make more
            specific selections as well. Here are some of the more common types
            of selectors:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Element selector: </strong>Sometimes called a tag or type
              selector. It selects all HTML elements of the specified type. For example:
              <code>p selects < p > </p></code>
            </li>
            <li><strong>ID selector: </strong>It selects the element on the page with the specified ID. On a given HTML page, each id value should be unique. For example: <code> #my-id
              selects < p id="my-id" > or < a id="my-id" > </code></li>
            <li><strong>Class selector: </strong>It selects the element(s) on the page with the specified class. Multiple instances of the same class can appear on a page. For example: <code>.my-class
              selects < p class="my-class" > and < a class="my-class" > </code></li>
            <li><strong>Attribute selector: </strong>It selects the element(s) on the page with the specified attribute. For example:<code>img[src]
              selects < img src="myimage.png" > but not < img > </code></li>
            <li><strong>Pseudo-class selector: </strong>It selects the specified element(s), but only when in the specified state. (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.) For example: <code>a:hover
              selects < a >, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link.</code></li>
              <li><strong>Combinators: </strong>It combines other selectors in order to target elements within our documents. For example: <code> article > p { } selects p that are direct children of < article > using the child combinator (>)</code></li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <p>
            CSS @rules (pronounced "at-rules") provide instruction for what CSS should perform or how it should behave. Some @rules are simple with just a keyword and a value.
          </p>
          <p>
            One common @rule that you are likely to encounter is @media, which is used to create media queries. Media queries use conditional logic for applying CSS styling.
          </p>
          <p>Media queries:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Let you adapt your site or app depending on the presence or value of various device characteristics and parameters.
            </li>
            <li>
              They are a key component of responsive design. For example, a media query can shrink the font size on small devices, increase the padding between paragraphs when a page is viewed in portrait mode, or bump up the size of buttons on touchscreens.
            </li>
            <li>
              In HTML, media queries can be applied to various elements:
              <ul>
                <li>In the "link" element's media attribute, they define the media to which a linked resource (typically CSS) should be applied.</li>
                <li>In the "source" element's media attribute, they define the media to which that source should be applied. (This is only valid inside < picture > elements.)</li>
                <li>In the "style" element's media attribute, they define the media to which the style should be applied. </li>
              </ul>

        <header>Colors</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, RGBA, HEX, HSL, HSLA values.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Predefined color names: </strong>
            In CSS, a color can be specified by using a color name. For example:
            <ul>
              <li>Tomato, Gray, Orange, SlateBlue, Violet, MediumSeaGreen, ...</li>
              <li>CSS/HTML support <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colors.asp">140 standard color names</a>.
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p><strong>RGB Value: </strong>A color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula: rgb(red, green, blue). Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255. For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0. To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0). To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).</p>
            <p><strong>RGBA Value: </strong>They are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color. An RGBA color value is specified with: rgba(red, green, blue, alpha) The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all).</p>
            <p><strong>HEX Value: </strong> In CSS, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form: #rrggbb. Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255). For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00).
          </p>
          <p><strong>HSL Value: </strong>A color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness). Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue. Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color. Lightness is also a percentage, 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white.</p>
          <p><strong>HSLA Value: </strong> An extension of HSL color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color. An HSLA color value is specified with: hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha). The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all).</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Background">
        <header>Background properties</header>
        <article>
          <p>The CSS background property is a shorthand for a number of background longhand properties. If you discover a complex background property in a stylesheet, it might seem a little hard to understand as so many values can be passed in at once.</p>
          <p>The background-color property defines the background color on any element in CSS. The property accepts any valid < color >. A background-color extends underneath the content and padding box of the element.</p>
          <p>The background-image property enables the display of an image in the background of an element.</p>
          <p>A gradient — when used for a background — acts just like an image and is also set by using the background-image property. The < gradient > CSS data type is a special type of < image > that consists of a progressive transition between two or more colors. </p>
          <p>It is also possible to have multiple background images — you specify multiple background-image values in a single property value, separating each one with a comma. When you do this you may end up with background images overlapping each other. The backgrounds will layer with the last listed background image at the bottom of the stack, and each previous image stacking on top of the one that follows it in the code.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>border-color: </strong>sets the color of an element's border. Each side can be set individually.</li>
