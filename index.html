            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages —
            for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your
            content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
            decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your
            path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the
            syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
            HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
            document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
            MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on
            screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of
            styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of
            elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on
            my page to be shown as large red text."

        <article>
          <p>
            The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that
            we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different
            ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come
            across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful
            way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.
          </p>
          <p>
            Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it
            as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.
          </p>
          <p>
            To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere
            inside the "head" of the HTML document:
            <br />
            <strong id="style">
              < link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" >
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This "link" element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet,
            using the rel attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the
            value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by
            adding a rule to styles.css.

            The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often
            referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Selector: </strong>This is the HTML element that we’re
              targeting. It can be an HTML tag, or it can be an ID or a Class
              (more about those later). The selector in this example is the
              anchor tag.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Declaration block start: </strong>An open curly brace "{"
              marks the start of a declaration block.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Property / Value separator: </strong>The colon : appears
              after the property.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Value: </strong>This is the value of the property. In this
              example, it’s white.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Declaration: </strong>The property/value pair combined is
              the declaration, indicated by the orange box in the above diagram.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Declaration separator: </strong>The semicolon ; marks the
              end of the declaration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Declaration block end: </strong>A closing curly brace "}"
              marks the end of a declaration block.

          <p>Declarations are style rules that add styling to HTML elements.</p>
          <p>
            By making our anchor tag white we have already demonstrated that we
            can target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an
            element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML
            element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use
            the selector "p".
          </p>
          <p>
            You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the
            selectors with a comma.

            braces ({ }).
          </li>
          <li>
            Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the
            property from its value or values.
          </li>
          <li>
            Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each
            declaration from the next one.
          </li>
          <li>

          <p>
            A selector targets HTML to apply styles to content. If CSS is not
            applying to content as expected, your selector may not match the way
            you think it should match. Each CSS rule starts with a selector — or
            a list of selectors — in order to tell the browser which element or
            elements the rules should apply to.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many different types of selectors. We can make more
            specific selections as well. Here are some of the more common types
            of selectors:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Element selector: </strong>Sometimes called a tag or type
              selector. It selects all HTML elements of the specified type. For example:
              <code>p selects < p > </p></code>
            </li>
            <li><strong>ID selector: </strong>It selects the element on the page with the specified ID. On a given HTML page, each id value should be unique. For example:<code> #my-id
              selects < p id="my-id" > or < a id="my-id" > </code></li>
            <li><strong>Class selector: </strong>It selects the element(s) on the page with the specified class. Multiple instances of the same class can appear on a page. For example:<code>.my-class
              selects < p class="my-class" > and < a class="my-class" > </code></li>
            <li><strong>Attribute selector: </strong>It selects the element(s) on the page with the specified attribute. For example:<code>img[src]
              selects < img src="myimage.png" > but not < img > </code></li>
            <li><strong>Pseudo-class selector: </strong>It selects the specified element(s), but only when in the specified state. (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.) For example:<code>a:hover
              selects < a >, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link.</code></li>
              <li><strong>Combinators: </strong>It combines other selectors in order to target elements within our documents. For example:<code> article > p { } selects paragraphs that are direct children of < article > elements using the child combinator (>)</code></li>
          </ul>

            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
            pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
            variables using the window.variable syntax.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
            or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
            frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
            declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
            iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
          </p>

      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
            The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
            identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
            and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
          </p>

          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
          <p>
            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
            while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
          </p>

          <p>
            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
            scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
            assumed to represent a variable.
          </p>

          <p>
            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
            variable in the same scope. For example:
          </p>

          <code
            >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
            WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
            //statements }</code
          >
          However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
          statement is executed without problems.
          <code
            >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
            "otherValue";</code

          <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>
                  null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                  JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                  NULL, or any other variant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                </li>
                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li>
                  Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                  are unique and immutable.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>and Object</li>
          </ul>
          Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
          you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
          functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
          think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
          procedures that your application can perform.

        <article>
          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
          condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:

          <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
          Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
          condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
          statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
          statement, including further nested if statements.
          <p>
            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
            conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
          </p>
          <code
            >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
            statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
            statement_last; }
          </code>
          In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
          which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
          statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
          general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
          when nesting if statements:

          <code
            >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
          >
          It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
          expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
          glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
          <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use
          an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
          additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

          <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>while statement</header>
        <article>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

          <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
          false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
          the statement following the loop.

          <p>
            The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
            If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
            condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
            stops and control is passed to the statement following while.

            To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
            group those statements.
          </p>

          Example:

          <p>
            The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
          </p>

          <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
          <p>
            With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
            Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
            <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
            <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
            true, so the loop terminates.

          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

          <ul>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>
              A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
              separated by commas.
            </li>
            <li>
              The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
              curly brackets, { }.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, the following code defines a simple function named
            square:
          </p>

          <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
          <p>
            The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
            consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
            function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
            statement specifies the value returned by the function.
          </p>
          <code>return number * number;</code>
          <p>
            Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
            value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
            changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
            globally or in the calling function.
